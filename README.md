# Nuxt Cookie Control
This is a fork of dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control that adds an option to remove the button to manage your cookies. This could be good if you want to have only an accept terms of services button for now where cookies are mentioned. But still have the flexibility of the cookies consent for a later date. 

ðŸš© Trying to keep this package up to date with the main branch, so go there for documentation [gitlab.com/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control](https://gitlab.com/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control), make sure to read the README!

Only added thing in this repository is an "isManageable" boolean module option.
